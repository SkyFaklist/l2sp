# l2sp
Use proxy with steam


How to use?

Execute with root privileges in the terminal

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkyFaklist/l2sp/master/l2sh.sh && chmod +x l2sh.sh && bash l2sh.sh

It may be a little difficult to set it up, but I believe you can

This project is inseparable from the support of the open source project 'proxychains'
